# excel-cleaning
Cleaning excel files for general use, using Python and openpyxl.

The user interface will be a local html document, using Python and Flask(?) as the backend. 

Functions included will be:
- Changing key words based on user input (cells and sheet names)
- Generating generic lists for replacement
- Changing (input?) values based on a specific %
- Creating a new excel file to save after cleaning
- Loading bar for uploading file and conversion.

Functions that need to be explored:
- Keeping shapes and images intact
- Maintaing data queries and connections without corrupting the file.
